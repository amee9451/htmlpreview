        You should have a URL similar to the following structure:

          https://github.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/blob/master/index.html
        Enter rawgit.com
        As the name implies rawgit shows serves the raw files directly from Github.

        To use it simply use the following format:

          https://rawgit.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/master/index.html
        If you want to use it in production you can use:

          https://cdn.rawgit.com/<your user name>/<your repo>/master/index.html
        That was easy now wasnâ€™t it!
